OOPS – Object-Oriented Programming System (Python)

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) concepts using Python.
OOPS is a programming paradigm based on the idea of objects, which combine data and behavior into a single unit.

This README gives a clear explanation of all core OOPS concepts with examples.

🧠 What is OOPS?

OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming style that organizes code into objects.
It helps in writing efficient, reusable, scalable, and maintainable programs.

Python supports OOP naturally and makes it easy to implement real-world concepts in code.
